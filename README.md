# Password Generator

This application is used to create a completely random password based on confirms and prompts the user answers. 

The generator will only function if a number between 8 and 128 characters is selected. 

The application will then prompt the user if they want uppercase, lowercase, numbers, or special characters. 

If user clicks 'Cancel" for all four options, an error will prompt the user to confirm at least option. 

After all prompts, a random password will be generated consisting of characters from all categories selected.
